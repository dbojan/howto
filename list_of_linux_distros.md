## list of linux distros compared, for beginners

2025-07-04-1

### tl dr: use linux mint, whichever version you like (cinammon, xfce ...)

### For beginners or moving from windows:

linux mint: recommened for new users, can be also used for gaming  
pro: simple to configure, looks like windows  
con: does not have the newest apps/drivers.  
recommended version: xfce for minimal bloat, cinnamon, win like, mate for older desktop like.  
(you can download say xfce inside installed distros and switch when loging in, so this is not that important)  

zorin os: also looks like windows, installation is big, comes with alot of stuff which you might or might not neeed.

fedora: new drivers and apps. has weird installer (partition manager)

mx linux: has a lot of configuration tools. does not use systemd, so when you google for stuff, search mx linux, how to ... (older apps and drivers, since it is based on debian distro)

cachy os, manjaro, endeavour os: based on arch linux, but made easy(er) for new users, (have not tested it myself)

nobara os, bazzite: advertised as for gaming, untested.

ubuntu and its subvariants (xubuntu, kubuntu..) forces use of snaps version of apps, which are usually slower. not recommened.

pop os: based on debian, but with newer version of apps drivers, untested.

debian: has old software, not user friendly. recommened for servers.

### advanced users: 

arch linix: not recommened for beginners

void linux: lean, not recommened for beginners.
